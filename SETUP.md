# Organiser App — Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech) PostgreSQL database (free tier is fine)
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (for deployment)

---

## Local Development

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
# Root (API + Prisma)
npm install

# Frontend
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in:
- `DATABASE_URL` — your Neon connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` — run `openssl rand -base64 48` to generate one
- `REGISTRATION_CODE` — the invite code you'll share with your partner

### 3. Push the database schema

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This creates all tables in your Neon database.

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:3001

### 5. Register your first account

Visit http://localhost:5173/register and use your `REGISTRATION_CODE` to create an account.

## Deploying to Vercel

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# Create a repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/organiser-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Import to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → New Project → Import your repo
2. Set the **Root Directory** to `/` (the repo root)
3. Add these **Environment Variables** in Vercel's dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL` — your Neon connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` — your JWT secret
   - `REGISTRATION_CODE` — your invite code
4. Deploy!

### 3. Run migrations on production

After deploying, run once in your local terminal (pointing at the production DB):

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-url" npm run db:push
```

Or use Neon's dashboard to verify the tables were created.

## Security

### Rate limiting
Login and register endpoints are rate-limited to **10 requests per IP per 15 minutes** using `express-rate-limit`. Exceeding the limit returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

> **Vercel note:** The rate limiter uses an in-memory store, so counters reset per serverless function instance. It works reliably in local development and provides partial protection in production. Vercel's built-in network-layer DDoS protection handles large volumetric attacks in production.

### Registration
Signup requires a `REGISTRATION_CODE` env var — only people with the code can create an account.

## Apple Calendar

Each user can subscribe to a live ICS feed of their tasks with due dates. To set it up:

1. Go to **Settings** in the app
2. Click **Get calendar link**
3. Click **Subscribe in Apple Calendar** — iOS/macOS will prompt to confirm

Tasks appear as all-day events on their due date. Apple Calendar refreshes roughly every hour; pull to refresh to force it. Works with any ICS-compatible app (Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook).

The feed token is a signed JWT valid for 1 year. Generate a new one from Settings at any time.

## Workout Planner

The workout module is self-contained and does not affect tasks or categories.

### Getting started
1. Navigate to **Workouts** in the sidebar
2. Go to **Exercise Library** → create your exercises (add YouTube/Vimeo video links for form guides)
3. Create a new **Plan** — choose days per week, configure each day type (Upper/Lower/Full Body/Cardio/Rest), and assign exercises with optional target sets/reps/weight
4. **Activate** the plan from the plans list
5. On the Workouts page, your active plan's days appear as cards — tap any day to start a workout

### Active workout flow
- Each exercise is shown one at a time with the last recorded values pre-filled
- Enter your actual sets, reps, and weight, then mark the exercise complete
- Set a rest timer (in minutes) — a beep sounds when time is up
- Work through all exercises; last values are saved automatically for next session

### Exercise categories & body areas
Default categories (Strength, Cardio, Mobility, HIIT, Flexibility) and body areas (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms, Legs, Core, Full Body) are auto-created on first use. You can add your own from the exercise creation form.
